# Data

Place your dataset CSV here (e.g., `BRCA Data.csv`).

This project was built around a Breast Cancer (BRCA) dataset used in the notebook.
Because datasets are often licensed or shared privately, the CSV is **not** included here.

If your notebook expects a filename like `BRCA Data.csv`, either:
1) Put it in this `data/` folder and update the notebook path accordingly, or
2) Copy it to the repo root (not recommended) so relative paths work.
